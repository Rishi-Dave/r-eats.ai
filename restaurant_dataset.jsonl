The architectural style of the original buildings and sign signify California\\u2019s farming culture.

A continuous raised deck will host dining and lounge areas in the shade of vine-covered trellises and shade trees. A mixture of permanent and pop-up kiosks line the garden, providing opportunities for local artists and makers to set up shop.
